have all been forked from the github Islandora account to my personal github account, grf.
I made a branch called flvc from the 7.x branches (except for the tuque library, which was branched from 1.x)

We need work in the flvc branch, pusing it back up to grf@github.com.

We also need to pull in the changes from the original Islandora 7.x (1.x for tuque) repos every now and then - those repositories are labeled 'upstream'

Of course we don't want to do that blindly; first we'll merge into our copy of the 7.x repos first to insepect the differences..

     git checkout 7.x
     git fetch upstream
     git merge upstream/7.x
     git push

     ... check it out ... we've got a copy of the Islandora guy's development version on-line

When we're sure it's workable: do

     git checkout flvc
     git fetch upstream
     git merge upstream/7.x

     ...work with it a bit...

     git push

And we do this for each of the 11 modules/tool sets...
